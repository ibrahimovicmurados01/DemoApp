I am writing to express my continued interest in the Software Engineer role and to provide an update regarding the test task that I recently completed.

The test task involved creating an ASP.NET MVC application, and I am pleased to inform you that I have successfully completed the task.

In the initial phase, I developed a MVC core application, ensuring that it aligns with best practices for security, reliability, and maintainability. 
The application included functionalities such as user registration, login, and contact management, each with appropriate validations.

For the unit testing aspect, I wrote several test cases to ensure the integrity and correctness of the application's functionality. 
I also prepared the application for deployment to Docker container. I crafted a Docker file using Docker container to automate the build and deployment process. 
It involved setting up tasks for restoring NuGet packages, building the solution, running unit tests, and deploying the application to a container. 

I am excited about the possibility of contributing to your team and believe that my skills in ASP.NET core MVC, unit testing, and docker DevOps make me a strong candidate for this role.
